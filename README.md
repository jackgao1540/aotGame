# Wordle Solver

## A Program to Solve Wordles

- What will this application do?
  - This java program aims to be able to guess a Wordle much like in the recent popular website, wordle.
  - The program will output guesses, with the user providing the accuracy of those guesses using a sequence of characters.
  - The user is the one who decides what the word is.
  - For example, if the word that the user chose was "WATER", and the program outputted "WATTS", the user would provide feedback in the form of "GGGOB", meaning green, green, green, orange, black.
  - Green means that the guess's character is in the  right position and matches.
  - Orange means that the character of the guess is somewhere else in the target word.
  - Black means that the letter is not in the target word.
- Who will use this app?
  - Most likely people who want to beat their friends at wordle (i.e. guessing the word in the least amount of guesses).
- Why is this project of interest to me?
  - Because I want to consistently beat my friends at wordle.
