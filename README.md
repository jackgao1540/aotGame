# Tiny Titan Tantrums

## A video game based on one of my favourite animes

- What will this application do?
  - The final stage of this application will be a cute video game where chibi titans are attacking your town, and you have to defeat them.
- Who will use this app?
  - People who want to have fun playing a cute game based on a famous anime.
- Why is this project of interest to me?
  - Because I really like AOT and video games. This first phase will simply implement a system for modelling the environment. The graphics and physics of the game have already been deeply brainstormed by me but it is a little too early to implement them fully as of right now.
